Mercurial indicator in zsh prompt is slow
  - profile which parts of it are the worst
  - maybe move the whole thing to a single Python script to save invocations?
Have brew function output to stderr
consolidate caskroom stuff so it doesn't have to prompt for password?
  - is it the tapping or the installations that require it?
  - look at https://github.com/vitorgalvao/dotfiles for renew_sudo
    - maybe move things out of Brewfile and into custom script?
  - add brew and cask cleanup commands
