Mercurial indicator in zsh prompt is slow
  - profile which parts of it are the worst
  - maybe move the whole thing to a single Python script to save invocations?
Figure out if we can somehow save/restore Atom and Sublime Text package lists
  - Atom possibilities:
    * https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/atom-package-install
    * https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/atom-package-backup
  - Sublime possibilities:
    * from the defaults script: cp -r init/Preferences.sublime-settings ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text*/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings 2> /dev/null
