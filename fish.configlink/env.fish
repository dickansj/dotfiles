## asdf shenanigans

#   not a bad idea, but it's alone in trying to do this
#   and I'd rather it behave like other asdf plugins.

## side-note: seems like the nodejs plugin for asdf is
##            bad? like, not well thought out at all?
##            look how its relevant environment vars
##            aren't even using the same prefix!
##            (and yes, these vars are specific to
##            asdf-nodejs, despite the naming.)
##            this is a real pity!
