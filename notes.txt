TODO:
Mercurial indicator in zsh prompt is slow
  - profile which parts of it are the worst
  - maybe move the whole thing to a single Python script to save invocations?
Modify Tor script to check for available network connections (with networksetup + ifconfig)
  - if there's only one active, just use it
  - if more than one, take choice from command line? allow user to choose from menu?
