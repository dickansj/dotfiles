This directory contains binary resources that I take with me everywhere.

## pandas
I've been using this image as my user icon since college. No reason to change
it yet. This is effectively as much a part of my dotfiles as my `$EDITOR`
definition. The full image that it's cropped from is in my Dropbox, so this repo
doesn't get *unnecessarily* bloated. :)

## ssh_config.base
The file that gets appended to the end of my `~/.ssh/config` after a new key is
added to it, so that servers without a corresponding key just ask for a password.

## Office Templates
Templates for MS Office. Set the location in Word's Preferences -> File Locations -> User Templates.

## Xcode Templates
Templates for Xcode. `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/resources/Xcode\ Templates ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Custom`
