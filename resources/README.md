This directory contains binary resources that I take with me everywhere.

## pandas
I've been using this image as my user icon since college. No reason to change
it yet. This is effectively as much a part of my dotfiles as my `$EDITOR`
definition. The full image that it's cropped from is in my Dropbox, so this repo
doesn't get *unnecessarily* bloated. :)

## utility_functions.sh
Right now just contains `link_file`, that gets used during installation and 
some other scripts here. Not general-purpose enough to put into the shell 
normally, and since it's part of setup, it will probably be running from bash 
and not zsh.
