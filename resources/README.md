This directory contains binary resources that I take with me everywhere.

My preferred monospaced font. I could install it with cask, but the cask formula
isn't pointing to the latest canonical version. Raph also might release an
update through unknown channels at some point... Either way, I'd rather just
track it myself.

I've been using this image as my user icon since college. No reason to change
it yet. This is effectively as much a part of my dotfiles as my `$EDITOR`
definition. The full image that it's cropped from is in my Dropbox, so this repo
doesn't get *unnecessarily* bloated. :)
